# Ludum Dare 37

This was my late attempt at [Ludum Dare 37](http://ludumdare.com/compo/).
I started very late so I did not manage to get much stuff done, but I wanted to try Typescript + 
[Phaser](https://phaser.io/).

You might wonder, what is this? Yeah me too.

## Run the game

`npm install`

`npm start`
